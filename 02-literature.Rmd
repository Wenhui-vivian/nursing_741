# The tidyverse

The **dplyr** package is part of the larger **tidyverse** package set which has expanded considerably in recent years and continues to grow in size and utility such that many people never learn the "older way" of doing things in R. But we've already been through that in the previous section. The tidyverse has the following packages. The descriptions have been lifted from the [tidyverse home page](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

**ggplot2** - ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

**dplyr** - dplyr provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. 

**tidyr** - tidyr provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable.

**readr** - readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes.

**tibble** - tibble is a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more forcing you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. 

**stringr** - stringr provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible. It is built on top of stringi, which uses the ICU C library to provide fast, correct implementations of common string manipulations.

**lubdriate** - Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on the type of date-time object being used. Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks. Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not.

## Installing

You will probably use a number of functions from several of these packages so it's best to go ahead and install the entire **tidyverse** in one go. To install it, do one of the following: 

1) At the R Console from within RStudio, type:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

2) Use the Tools -> Install Packages menu item in RStudio:

After you have installed the package you may load it by doing:

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

## dplyr Basics

**dplyr** is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges. In fact if you were paying attention during the opening section on data frames you will have noticed that most of the activities we performed related to the following activires. In dplyr-speak there are the **verbs** that help us get work done.


    mutate() - adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
    select() - picks variables based on their names.
    filter() - picks cases based on their values.
    summarise() - reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
    arrange() - changes the ordering of the rows.


## First Steps

Note that this material references ["Becoming a data ninja with dplyr"](https: //speakerdeck.com/dpastoor/becoming-a-data-ninja-with-dplyr) as well as [this dplyr tutorial]( http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html)

We'll go back to the basics here by using a very small data frame which will make it clear how the various **dplyr** verbs actually work:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id = 1:5,
                 gender = c("MALE","MALE","FEMALE","MALE","FEMALE"),
                 age = c(70,76,60,64,68))
```

![](./figures/df1.png){width=400}


### filter()

The **filter()** function allows us to sift through the data frame to find rows that satisfy some logical condition. (With the older approach we would be using the bracket notation). The following example allows is to find only the observations relating to a declared gender of **female**.

```{r}
filter(df,gender == "FEMALE")

# Given this data frame, the following is equivalent 

filter(df, gender != "MALE")
```

![](./figures/df2.png)


So, now find only the **ids** that relate to rows 1,3, or 5. This is a highly specialized search but it is helpful to show that you can use a wide variety of logical constructs.

```{r}
filter(df, id %in% c(1,3,5))
```

![](./figures/df3.png)

### mutate()

Mutate is used to add or remove columns in a data frame. Let's create a new column in the data frame that contains the mean value of the age column.

```{r}
mutate(df,meanage = mean(age))
```

![](./figures/meanage.png)


Next we will create a new column designed to tell us if a given observation has an age that is greater than or equal to the average age. Specifically, create a variable called **old_young** and assign a value of "Y" if the observed age for that row is above the mean age and a value of "N" if it is not.

```{r}
mutate(df,old_young=ifelse(df$age>=mean(df$age),"Y","N"))
```

One way we could use something like this is in making a plot where the observations exhibiting an age value above the mean are plotted in a certain color and those below the mean are in another color.

```{r}
tmp <- mutate(df, color = ifelse(age > mean(age),"red","blue")) 

plot(tmp$age,col=tmp$color, type="p",
     pch=19,main="Ages",ylab="Age") 

grid()

abline(h=mean(tmp$age),lty=2)

legend("topright",
       c("Above Avg","Below Avg"),col=c("red","blue"),pch=19)
```

### arrange()

Use arrange for sorting the data frame by one or more columns. When using the basic data frame structure from R we had to use the **order()** function to help us generate a vector that has the row numbers of the data frame that correpsond to the desired order of display (lowest to highest, etc). 

Let's sort the data frame **dff** by age from oldest to youngest.
First we'll use the older approach. While this will work, it is not exactly very intuitive.

```{r}
df[rev(order(df$age)),]
```

**dplyr** makes this process more simple - at least in my opinion

```{r}
arrange(df,desc(age))
```

Next, let's sort **df** by gender (alphabetically) and then by age
from olderst to youngest. The rows relating to a gender of **female** are going to be listed first because, alphabetically speaking, the letter "F" comes before the letter "M". Then within those categories we have the ages sorted from oldest to youngest.

```{r}
arrange(df, gender,desc(age))
```

If we used the older approach it would look like the following. Ugh !

```{r}
df[order(df$gender,-df$age),]
```

### select()

The select() functions allows us to select one or more columns from a data frame.

```{r}
# Reorder the columns
select(df,gender,id,age)  
```


```{r}
# Select all but the age column
select(df,-age)
```

```{r}
# Can use the ":" operator to select a range
select(df,id:age) 
```

The select() function provides the ability to select by "regular expressions"" or numeric patterns:

```{r}
# Select all columns that start with an "a"
select(df,starts_with("a"))
```

```{r}
names(mtcars)

# Get only columns that start with "c"

select(mtcars,starts_with("c"))
```

This example is more realistic in that data frames can have a large number of columns named according to some convention. For example, the measurements on a patient might not be labelled specifically - they might have a common prefix such as "m_" followed by some sequential number (or not). 

```{r}
testdf <- expand.grid(m_1=seq(60,70,10),
                      age=c(25,32),
                      m_2=seq(50,60,10),
                      m_3=seq(60,70,10))
```


```{r}
testdf
```


Find all the columns that include a "_" character

```{r}
select(testdf,matches("_"))
```

This will select columns beginning with "m_" but only those with a suffx of 1 or 2.

```{r}
select(testdf,num_range("m_",1:2))
```

### group_by()

The **group_by()** function let’s you organize a data frame by some factor or grouping variable. This a very powerful function that is typically used in conjunction with a function called **summarize**. Here is what it looks like by itself. It's somewhat underwhelming. It does seem to create table of some kind but it doesn't do much else. 

```{r}
df

# Hmm. the following doesn't do anything - or so it seems

group_by(df)
```

So as mentioned, the **group_by** function is usually paired with the **summarize** function. Ah. so what this does is to first group the data frame by the **gender** column and then it **counts** the number of occurrences therein. So this is a form of aggregation.

```{r}
summarize(group_by(df,gender),total=n())
```

![](./figures/grp.png)

Let's group the data frame by gender and then compute the average age for each group.

```{r}
summarize(group_by(df,gender),av_age=mean(age))
```

![](./figures/grpa.png)

Let's group by gender and then compute the total number of observations in each gender group and then compute the mean age. 

```{r}
summarize(group_by(df,gender),av_age=mean(age),total=n())
```

# Split Apply Combine

This pattern of using **group_by()** followed by **summarize()** 
is called **Split Apply Combine**. The idea is that we 

1) Split up the data frame by gender group
2) Then for each group, apply the average function
3) Then combine the average results with each group

```{r}
group_by(df,gender)
```

## What Are Pipes ?

Before moving forward let us consider the "pipe" operator that is included with the dplyr - well actually **magrittr** package. This is used to make it possible to "pipe" the results of one command into another command and so on.

The inspiration for this comes from the UNIX/LINUX operating system where pipes are used all the time. So in effect using "pipes" is nothing new in the world of research computation. **Warning:** Once you get used to pipes it is hard to go back to not using them. 

Let’s use the mtcars data frame to illustrate the basics of the piping mechanism as used by dplyr. Here we will select the **mpg** and **am** column from mtcars and view the top 5 rows.

```{r}
head(select(mtcars, mpg, am))
```

Okay, how would we do this using pipes ? Whoa !

```{r}
mtcars %>% select(mpg, am) %>% head
```

Break this down:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select(mpg, am)
```

The key to understanding how this works is to **read** this from left to right. Let's use our new found knowledge to reimagine our use of the **group_by** and **summarize** functions. 

## Pipes and Split Apply Combine

```{r}
df %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarize(avg=mean(age))

# Same as this but the pipes are far more elegant

summarize(group_by(df,gender), avg=mean(age))
```

This approach allows us to build a "pipeline" containing commands. We don't have to commit to a specific sequence. This enables a free-form type of exploration.

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(avg=mean(age),total=n())
```

What is the median age of all males ? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(gender == "MALE") %>% 
  summarize(med_age=median(age))
```

Using the built in mtcars dataframe, **filter** for records where the wt is greater than 3.3 tons.

Then, using the **mutate** function, create a column called ab_be (Y or N) that indicates whether that observation’s mpg is greater (or not) than the average mpg for the filtered set.

Then present the average mpg for each group. This is easy using pipes and dplyr verbs

```{r}
mtcars %>% filter(wt > 3.3)  %>%
          mutate(ab_be=ifelse(mpg > mean(mpg),"Y","N")) %>%
          group_by(ab_be) %>% 
          summarize(mean_mpg=mean(mpg))
```
